.TH "ipa-server-install" "1" "Jun 28 2012" "FreeIPA" "FreeIPA Manual Pages"
.SH "NAME"
ipa\-server\-install \- Configure an IPA server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-server\-install [\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Configures the services needed by an IPA server. This includes setting up a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) and a Kadmin daemon with an LDAP back\-end, configuring Apache, configuring NTP and optionally configuring and starting an LDAP-backed DNS server. By default a dogtag\-based CA will be configured to issue server certificates.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "BASIC OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fIREALM_NAME\fR, \fB\-\-realm\fR=\fIREALM_NAME\fR
The Kerberos realm name for the IPA server. You will not be able to estabilish trust with Active Directory unless the realm name is uppercased domain name.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fIDOMAIN_NAME\fR, \fB\-\-domain\fR=\fIDOMAIN_NAME\fR
Your DNS domain name
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIDM_PASSWORD\fR, \fB\-\-ds\-password\fR=\fIDM_PASSWORD\fR
The password to be used by the Directory Server for the Directory Manager user
.TP
\fB\-P\fR \fIMASTER_PASSWORD\fR, \fB\-\-master\-password\fR=\fIMASTER_PASSWORD\fR
The kerberos master password (normally autogenerated)
.TP
\fB\-a\fR \fIADMIN_PASSWORD\fR, \fB\-\-admin\-password\fR=\fIADMIN_PASSWORD\fR
The password for the IPA admin user
.TP
\fB\-\-mkhomedir\fR
Create home directories for users on their first login
.TP
\fB\-\-hostname\fR=\fIHOST_NAME\fR
The fully\-qualified DNS name of this server. If the hostname does not match system hostname, the system hostname will be updated accordingly to prevent service failures.
.TP
\fB\-\-ip\-address\fR=\fIIP_ADDRESS\fR
The IP address of this server. If this address does not match the address the host resolves to and --setup-dns is not selected the installation will fail. If the server hostname is not resolvable, a record for the hostname and IP_ADDRESS is added to /etc/hosts.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-no\-ntp\fR
Do not configure NTP
.TP
\fB\-\-idstart\fR=\fIIDSTART\fR
The starting user and group id number (default random)
.TP
\fB\-\-idmax\fR=\fIIDMAX\fR
The maximum user and group id number (default: idstart+199999). If set to zero, the default value will be used.
.TP
\fB\-\-no_hbac_allow\fR
Don't install allow_all HBAC rule. This rule lets any user from any host access any service on any other host. It is expected that users will remove this rule before moving to production.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-ui\-redirect\fR
Do not automatically redirect to the Web UI.
.TP
\fB\-\-ssh\-trust\-dns\fR
Configure OpenSSH client to trust DNS SSHFP records.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-ssh\fR
Do not configure OpenSSH client.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-sshd\fR
Do not configure OpenSSH server.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Enable debug logging when more verbose output is needed
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-unattended\fR
An unattended installation that will never prompt for user input


.SS "CERTIFICATE SYSTEM OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-\-external\-ca\fR
Generate a CSR for the IPA CA certificate to be signed by an external CA.
.TP
\fB\-\-external_cert_file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
File containing the IPA CA certificate signed by the external CA in PEM format. Must be given with \-\-external_ca_file.
.TP
\fB\-\-external_ca_file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
File containing the external CA certificate chain in PEM format. Must be given with \-\-external_cert_file.

If the CA certificate chain is in PKCS#7 format you can convert it to PEM using:

    openssl pkcs7 -in PKCS7_FILE -print_certs -out PEM_FILE
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-pkinit\fR
Disables pkinit setup steps
.TP

PKCS#12 file containing the Apache Server SSL Certificate
.TP
\fB\-\-pkinit_pkcs12\fR=\fIFILE\fR
PKCS#12 file containing the Kerberos KDC SSL certificate
.TP

The password of the Directory Server PKCS#12 file
.TP
\fB\-\-http_pin\fR=\fIHTTP_PIN\fR
The password of the Apache Server PKCS#12 file
.TP
\fB\-\-pkinit_pin\fR=\fIPKINIT_PIN\fR
The password of the Kerberos KDC PKCS#12 file
.TP
\fB\-\-root\-ca\-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
PEM file containing the CA certificate of the CA which issued the Directory Server, Apache Server and Kerberos KDC SSL certificates. Use this option if the CA certificate is not present in the PKCS#12 files.
.TP
\fB\-\-subject\fR=\fISUBJECT\fR
The certificate subject base (default O=REALM.NAME)

.SS "DNS OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-\-setup\-dns\fR
Generate a DNS zone if it does not exist already and configure the DNS server.
This option requires that you either specify at least one DNS forwarder through
the \fB\-\-forwarder\fR option or use the \fB\-\-no\-forwarders\fR option.

Note that you can set up a DNS at any time after the initial IPA server install by running
.B ipa-dns-install
(see
.BR ipa-dns-install (1)).
.TP
\fB\-\-forwarder\fR=\fIIP_ADDRESS\fR
