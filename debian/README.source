Upstream does not ship unminified copies of various javascript files, so we must ship them
in debian/missing-sources. Minified build.js and dojo.js are built with a certain set of
modules, so those bits are under missing-sources/{build,dojo}. The list of modules are listed on
install/ui/src/build.profile.js and install/ui/src/dojo.profile.js.
